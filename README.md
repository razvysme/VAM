# The VAM (Vibrotactile Actuator for Music)

This is the VAM, a tactile display i designed. I use it for sensory substitution/augmentation research, mostly focusing on hearing impaired or cochelear implant users.

I used Autodesk suite to 3d scan a clay prototype of the VAM, and fix the topology. I export to OBJ for 3d printing, therefore the .obj files are considered "final", and the .mb files are the source of those (usually containing more parts than exported).

The VAM is designed to work with the TactileLabs Tactuator BM1C, power externally. Version 3 has the actuator on the bottom, while version 3.1 has actuator on the top.
